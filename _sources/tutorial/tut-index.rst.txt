Tutorial
========
These tutorials introduce the core ideas behind the noise model and the correction strategy implemented in mri-noiselab, using synthetic images where ground truth is known.

The examples are designed to be simple and controlled, so that the effect of Rayleigh noise estimation and subtraction can be clearly observed and quantified. They progressively introduce:

   :maxdepth: 1

   uniform_image
   three_levels
   three_rois

Together, these tutorials help build intuition before applying the method to real MRI data
