API reference
=============

This module designed for research and educational purposes, provides utilities
to estimate and remove Rayleigh-distributed noise from magnetic resonance (MRI) 
magnitude images using a background-based approach derived from the Rician noise model.

The public functions are:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   subtract-noise

   subtract-noise-masked

subtract_noise_masked() enables the use of numpy masked arrays with the subtract_noise()
function, which does not natively support masks.
